# 3D_Scene_Reconstruction
3D Scene Reconstruction for a sport facility using a 2D image.
Normally if there are 2D images and Point clouds data available for the same facility. I can perform 2D and Point Clouds Alignment.
In order to convert the 2D image to Point clouds.
First step: convert the 2D image to a Depth image:

Adavantage:

Depth Perception: Depth information provides a sense of the relative distance of objects within a scene. By converting a 2D image to a depth image, you can enhance depth perception and enable better understanding of the spatial layout of objects in the scene.

3D Reconstruction: Depth images are commonly used in 3D reconstruction tasks to estimate the 3D structure of a scene. By converting a 2D image to a depth image, you can derive depth values for each pixel, which can be used as input for 3D reconstruction algorithms.
